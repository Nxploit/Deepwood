## Why?



We at Deepwood specialize in developing cutting-edge remote access trojan (RAT) software solutions that prioritize both functionality and security. While existing platforms such as Pegasus have set a high standard in this domain, we recognized the need for a more tailored approach to meet the evolving demands of our clientele.

By harnessing the power of Vue, Quasar, and FastAPI, we empower our clients with a comprehensive solution that delivers unparalleled functionality, security, and performance in the realm of remote trojan software.
